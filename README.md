- **GET /tasks/:id:** Retrieve a single task by its ID.
- **PUT /tasks/:id:** Update an existing task by its ID.
- **DELETE /tasks/:id:** Delete a task by its ID.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the back-end server is running before starting the front-end application to avoid CORS issues.
- The front-end application uses the Fetch API to communicate with the back-end server.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication and authorization.
- Implement task prioritization and categorization.
- Enhance the UI with more advanced styling and animations.
